<!-- <h3> Cover Letter for Anti-ISIS Leaflet Distribution to Non-Muslim Neighbours  </h3> -->
 
 <!-- <p> Dear Friend or Neighbour,
I am a Muslim who lives locally and wanted to share an important message. Without doubt, you will be
just as shocked and disturbed by the recent acts of terrorism as I am. However, I have greater reason to
be disturbed because they are being perpetrated in the name of my religion, Islām. I kindly ask you to
take just a few minutes of your precious time to reflect on the following:
As a non-Muslim, you will most likely be unaware that the ideology behind these actions of terrorism
has been well known to Islāmic scholars for 1400 years. It is documented in great detail in scholarly
works dating back to the earliest centuries of Islām. Its proponents are known as the Khārijites
(extremist renegades), and their history lies in revolting against Muslim leaders, starting with the best of
the companions of the Prophet of Islām, Muḥammad, peace be upon him. They challenged the integrity
of the Prophet himself in the distribution of charities. He prophesized their continued appearance as an
armed, insurgent, renegade group against the Muslims. Appearing only 25 years later, they assassinated
the third caliph, Uthmān. They assassinated the fourth caliph, Ali, who was the Prophet’s cousin and
son-in-law. They attempted but failed to assassinate the leaders of Syria and Egypt, both of whom were
companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him. They believed unjustly that all of these Muslim leaders
had left Islām. Motivated by personal grievances and worldly pursuits that were developed into a
political ideology, they broke off from the main body of Muslims and set up their own “Islamic State”
near Baghdad in the year 657CE. They then began to actively recruit the ignorant under the cloak of
religion and started to slaughter Muslims who did not agree with their extremist views. Their first
slaughter was the Prophet’s companion ʿAbdullah bin Khabbāb and his household which included a
pregnant woman. They sliced her stomach and killed both her and her unborn child. Alī, the Prophet’s
cousin, fought and defeated them in 659CE but their seeds remained in the form of survivors who
dispersed to various Islamic lands such as Egypt, parts of Syria and Iraq and elsewhere. Alī was
assassinated by them less than two years later in an act of bloodthirsty revenge. This group and its
ideology have been plaguing Muslim for 1400 years. The history books make mention of the millions of
Muslims that were slaughtered as a result of their revolutionary activities against the Muslim rulers and
their subjects over the centuries. The acts of terrorism we are witnessing today are inseparably tied to
this evil political ideology which resurfaced in Egypt during the 1960s and spread to other lands. These
criminals were committing assassinations, bombings and mass slaughter in the Muslim lands well before
similar atrocities began to take place in Western lands. In Algeria during the 1990s, they slaughtered
tens of thousands of Muslims after expelling them from Islām, merely because they did not agree with
their excommunication of the ruler, his government and its army and join them in their revolution.
Research published by the Kings College Centre for Study of Radicalisation in January 2015 entitled “The
New Jihadism”shows that the equivalent of three 7/7 terrorist attacks are taking place every day and
killing on average 180 Muslims daily in places of conflict such as Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and
others where this ideology is to be found, whether in the form of al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, Nuṣrah, ISIS or
other insurgent groups. Western interests and interventions in these countries provide fertile ground
for these extremists to appear amidst the chaos, spread their corrupt ideology and justify their evil
actions. The terrorist acts we see in the West - no less reprehensible - are given extensive coverage in
the media leading to the faulty perception that these people are primarily at war with non-Muslims in
the West. This is not an accurate picture because their alleged “Jihād” is directed primarily at Muslim
rulers and their subjects as is explicit in their writings and statements. Conflict with non-Muslims is
secondary to them. As you can gather from the above, this ideology and its proponents are at war
against Islām and Muslims before anyone else. No fair-minded, just person can associate this ideology
with Islām after learning the above and make the average Muslim responsible for acts of terrorism.
Islām has placed great emphasis on kindness to the neighbour. This being my religious duty, I have
included some literature with this letter which may help to alleviate some of the stresses and worries
you might have experienced as a result of what the media (and right-wing elements) may convey,
unjustly associating these acts of terrorism with Islām. Radical extremists given airtime or showcased on
the media are shunned and despised by the vast majority of Muslims. It is a shame they receive such
high exposure which comprises a type of fearmongering that incites right-wing elements in the society.
If you have developed negative perceptions about Islām or Muslims, it is perfectly understandable. I
hope this information will bring greater understanding and possibly alter your perception of millions of
innocent, ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who are likely to suffer harassment and possible harm as a
result of these abhorrent actions which have nothing to do with them or with Islām in the least.
Kindest regards and thank you for your time.
A Muslim neighbour.
